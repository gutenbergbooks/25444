<p><span class='smcap'>Do</span> you know what <i>envy</i>
means? I hope you have
never felt it, for it is a very
wicked feeling. It is being
sorry when another has any
good thing. Perhaps you will
know better what the word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
means when you have read
my story; and I hope it will
help you to keep the feeling
away from your own heart.</p>

<p>Not far from Mr. Lee's
house, in Riverdale, lived a
man by the name of Green.
He was the agent of one of
the factories in the village.
Mr. Green had two little girls
and three sons. The boys
have nothing to do with my
story, and for that reason I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
shall not say a great deal
about them.</p>

<p>Katy, Mr. Green's older
daughter, was ten years old.
She was a pretty good girl,
but she did not like to have
others get good things, when
she did not have any herself.
If any person gave one of
her brothers an apple, or an
orange, she seemed to think
she ought to have it.</p>

<p>When she was a baby, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
used to cry for every thing
she saw, and would give her
parents no peace till they gave
it to her. I am sorry to say
they were sometimes very
weak on this point, and gave
her things which she ought not
to have had, just to quiet her.</p>

<p>Her father and mother
hoped, when she grew older,
she would not want every
thing that belonged to her
brothers. If Charles had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
plaything, Katy wanted it, and
would cry till she got it. Very
often, just to make her stop
crying, her mother made poor
Charley give up the thing.</p>

<p>But as Katy grew older, she
seemed to want every thing
that others had just as much
as ever. She was now ten
years old, and still she did not
like to see others have any
thing which she could not
have. It is true she did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
always say so, but she felt it
just as much, and was very
apt to be cross and sullen towards
those whom she envied.</p>

<p>Nellie Green was not at all
like her sister. She was only
eight years old, but there was
not a bit of envy in her. She
would give a part, and often
the whole, of her apples,
oranges, candy, and playthings
to her sister, and to her brothers.
She liked to see them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
happy, and when Charley ate
an apple, it tasted just as good
to her as though she were
eating it herself.</p>

<p>She was not selfish. She
would always divide her good
things with her friends. Did
you ever see a little boy or a
little girl eating an apple or
some candy, and another little
boy or girl standing by, and
looking just as if he wanted
some?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Nellie always gave her
friends a part, and then she
not only enjoyed what she ate
herself, but she enjoyed what
they ate. This is the way to
make apples, oranges, and candy
taste good.</p>

<p>One New Year's Day, Katy's
aunt, after whom she was
named, sent her a beautiful
wax doll. It was a very pretty
doll, and the little girl was
the happiest child in Riverdale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
when the welcome present
reached her.</p>

<p>There was another little girl
in Riverdale who was almost
if not quite as happy; and that
was Nellie, her sister. It is
true, the doll was not for her;
she did not own any of it, and
Katy would hardly let her
touch it; but for all this, Nellie
was pleased to see her
sister so happy.</p>

<p>The dolly's name was Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Jane; for Katy thought, as she
was a very fine doll, she ought
to have a very fine name. So,
when she spoke to the doll,&mdash;and
she talked a great deal
with her,&mdash;she always called
her Lady Jane.</p>

<p>The two little girls had five
or six other dolls, but none of
them were any thing near
such fine ladies as Lady Jane.
Their heads were made of
porcelain, or rubber, or com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>position,
and they had grown
so old that they were really
ugly.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy, who had a rubber
head, looked as though
she "had been through the
wars." Her nose was worn
out, so that she had a great
hole in the end of it. I suppose,
if she had wanted to
sneeze, this hole would have
been very handy; but Miss
Lucy was a very proper young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
lady, and never sneezed in
company. If she ever sneezed
when alone, of course there
was no one present to know
any thing about it.</p>

<p>There was another hole
right in the top of her head,
so that if she had had any
brains, they would certainly
have leaked out; but as Miss
Lucy was not a strong-minded
woman, I suppose she had no
use for brains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the family of dolls
was a little black girl, whose
name was Dinah. She had
seen hard service in her day,
and did not look as though
is she would last much longer.</p>

<p>Miss Fanny had once been
a fine lady, but times had gone
hard with her, and her fine
clothes were both ragged and
dirty. But hard times were
not so very bad, for she wore
the same smile as when her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
clothes had been new and
nice.</p>

<p>Miss Mary was a poor cripple.
By a sad accident she
had broken one of her legs.
Katy placed her on a table
one day, and either because
the height from the floor
made her dizzy, or because
she was laid too near the
edge, she had tumbled off,
and one leg was so badly
broken that neither a wooden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
nor a cork one could be fastened
in its place.</p>

<p>Therefore Miss Mary could
not walk about the room, and
never went any where, except
when she was carried. But
she was not half so badly off
as Miss Susie, who had broken
her neck, and lost off her
head. The head was tied on
with a string, but it kept
falling off while the family
were at play; but Miss Susie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
did not seem to mind it at
all.</p>

<p>She got along a great deal
better without her head than
you and I could without ours.
Indeed, she wore the same
smile upon her face whether
the head was on or off&mdash;which
teaches us that we
ought always to be cheerful
in misfortune.</p>

<p>Besides these fine young
ladies there were two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
rag babies; but as you could
not tell by the looks of them
what they were thinking about,
I will not say any thing about
them. They had no virtues
worth telling; they never ate
soup with a fork, or gave
money to the poor.</p>

<p>Some of my readers may
not think much of this family
of dollies, but I am sure Katy
and Nellie had fine times with
them. They used to spend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hours together with them, and
the dollies used to do every
thing that any body could do.</p>

<p>Miss Fanny used to visit a
great deal, in spite of her
dirty, ragged clothes; so did
Miss Lucy, with two holes in
her head, and Miss Mary, with
her broken leg, and Miss Susie,
with her broken neck. All
of them used to go a-visiting,
except Miss Dinah, and she,
being a black girl, had to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the sweeping and tend the
door.</p>

<p>These ladies were all of
them so bashful that they
would not speak in company,
and Katy and Nellie had to
do all the talking for them.</p>

<p>But they used to "make
believe" the dollies talked,
and this did just as well.
They used to say just such
things as the ladies did who
called on Mrs. Green, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
never left without being urged
to stay longer, and also to
call again; which they always
promised to do.</p>

<p>On the whole, they were
very wonderful dollies; at
least they were until Lady
Jane came, and she was such
a fine lady, with her white silk
dress and her <i>real</i> hair, that
none of them could shine after
that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II.</h2>


<p><span class='smcap'>One</span> day Flora Lee came
to see Nellie Green, and to
spend the afternoon with her.
It was in the month of November,
and the weather was
too cold to permit them to
play in the garden; so they
said they would have a good
time in the house.</p>

<p>Katy Green had to go away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and could not play with them.
Nellie was very sorry for this,
for she not only liked to have
her sister with her, but she
also wanted the company of
Lady Jane.</p>

<p>She told Flora how sorry
she was, and they agreed that
it was too bad Katy had to
go away, for she was older
than they, and could help
them a great deal in their
plays. Besides, they wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
one fine lady among the dollies,
for they had a certain
play which required just such
a person.</p>

<p>"I wish I had brought Miss
Dolly with me. I guess she
is fine enough," said Flora.</p>

<p>"I wish you had," replied
Nellie; "but as you have not,
we can't help it now. I dare
say Miss Fanny will do."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you can
do, Nellie."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You can just ask Katy to
lend you her dolly. We won't
hurt her a mite, you know.
We will use her just as if
she were made of glass."</p>

<p>Nellie did not know what
to say. She did not like to
ask Katy to let her play with
Lady Jane, for she knew how
careful her sister was of her
fine lady. And she did not
like to tell Flora her thoughts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
lest she should think her sister
was selfish. She did not like
to have any one think hard of
her sister.</p>

<p>"We must have Lady Jane.
I don't see how we can get
along without her," added
Flora, a little puzzled by the
silence of Nellie.</p>

<p>"I don't like to ask Katy,"
said Nellie, at last.</p>

<p>"Why not? She will let
you have her. Of <i>course</i> she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
will let you have her," added
Flora, warmly.</p>

<p>"I don't think she will. You
know we might break her
neck, or lose off her legs or
arms; or we might dirty her
white silk dress."</p>

<p>"But we will be very careful.
Let us go and ask her.
It won't do any harm to ask
her, you know. She can't do
any more than refuse."</p>

<p>Nellie did not like to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
refused, and she tried to prevent
Flora from going any
farther in the matter. She
was sorry to have it appear
that her sister was selfish, and
she thought more of this than
she did of being refused.</p>

<p>Flora said so much that at
last she thought Katy might
let her have the doll, and they
ran down stairs to the sitting
room, to have the matter settled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you lend us your
dolly, Katy?" asked Nellie,
and the tones of her voice
showed how doubtful she was
of the result of the question.</p>

<p>"What dolly do you mean?"
asked Katy.</p>

<p>"Your wax dolly&mdash;Lady
Jane."</p>

<p>"I am very sure I shall not,"
replied Katy.</p>

<p>"We will be very careful of
her," added Flora. "We won't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
let her be hurt a bit&mdash;you
may depend on that."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to let you
have my dolly to break and
spoil&mdash;I'm sure I shall not,"
said Katy; who even seemed
to be angry because she was
asked.</p>

<p>"But don't I say we won't
hurt it a bit?" continued Flora.
"And when you come
over to my house, you shall
have my dolly just as long as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
you want her; and her house
too, and all the chairs and
tables and things."</p>

<p>"I don't want them."</p>

<p>"Do please to let us have
Lady Jane," teased Nellie.
"We want her ever so much;
and I know she won't get
broken or dirty. Please to
lend her to us, Katy."</p>

<p>"I shan't do any such thing;
so it's no use to tease me.
Why don't you play with your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
own dollies? I won't lend
Lady Jane&mdash;that's flat."</p>

<p>Nellie felt so bad she could
not help crying,&mdash;not because
she could not have the doll,
but because her sister was so
harsh and unkind. She would
not have cared so much if
Flora had not been there, for
she did not like to have her
see her sister behave in this
manner.</p>

<p>Poor Flora wanted to cry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
too, when she saw how badly
Nellie felt; but she tried to
be brave, and placed her arm
round her friend's neck, as if
to let her know that she would
be kind to her.</p>

<p>"Come, Nellie, let's go up
stairs again. We won't say
any thing more about it," said
Flora; and she led her out of
the room.</p>

<p>"Now you won't like Katy,
after this," replied Nellie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, yes, I will."</p>

<p>"Katy would have lent us
the dolly, only aunt Jane gave
it to her, and she is afraid it
will be broken. If it hadn't
been for this, she would have
lent us Lady Jane&mdash;I know
she would," added Nellie, wiping
away her tears.</p>

<p>"I dare say she would; but
we won't think any thing more
about it. And when I come
over again, some time, I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
bring her something, just to
show her that I don't feel hard
towards her."</p>

<p>"What a dear, good girl
you are, Flora! I was afraid
you would hate her after what
she said."</p>

<p>"O, dear, no, I should hope
not. My mother tells me I
must love those who don't do
what I want them to; and I
try to do so; but it is very
hard sometimes. I wish you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
had a wax doll, Nellie. You
ought to have one, you are
such a good girl, and love
your sister so much, even
when she is not kind to you."</p>

<p>"I wish I had one; it would
be so nice to have one like
Lady Jane. I should be so
happy; but then if only one
of us can have one, I would
rather Katy had it than have
it myself."</p>

<p>"You are not a bit selfish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Nellie. Do you know what
<i>selfish</i> means? I do."</p>

<p>"I guess I do. It means
when you have an apple or
any candy to refuse to give a
part to your sister."</p>

<p>"Yes, or to any body that
happens to be with you. Candy
is good, but don't you like
to see others eat it almost as
well as you do to eat it yourself?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I think I do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you know just what
I mean, and I guess we'll play
'visiting' now."</p>

<p>"So we will; and Miss Fanny
shall be the great lady, and
Dinah shall be her servant."</p>

<p>"Yes, and this shall be her
house," said Nellie, as she
placed Miss Fanny in a large
arm chair which they were to
"make believe" was her elegant
mansion.</p>

<p>"You shall stay here, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
will bring Miss Mary to visit
Miss Fanny."</p>

<p>Flora bounded over to the
other side of the room, which
was supposed to be the home
of the other dolls, and Miss
Mary, in spite of her broken
leg, was soon on her way to
visit the fine lady.</p>

<p>"Ting, a ling, a ling!" said
Flora, which meant that the
caller had rung the bell, and
Dinah appeared at the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is Miss Fanny at home?"
asked Flora, speaking for the
lady with the broken leg.</p>

<p>"No, marm, she is not," replied
Nellie, who had to speak
for Dinah, because, though her
mouth was very large, she
could not speak for herself.</p>

<p>"What an awful fib!" cried
Flora. "There she is; don't
I see her through the door?"</p>

<p>"But that's just the way
some of the fine folks do," re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>plied
Nellie, laughing at Flora's
earnestness.</p>

<p>"It is an awful story, and I
wouldn't say it even in fun."</p>

<p>Nellie said she would not
say it again, only she wanted
to have Miss Fanny do just as
the big folks did. And so
they played all the afternoon,
though Lady Jane did not
honor them with her company.
All the dollies paid lots of
visits; and Flora went home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III.</h2>


<p><span class='smcap'>When</span> Flora reached home,
she told her mother what a
nice time she had, and what
splendid visits Miss Lucy and
Miss Mary and Miss Susie had
made to Miss Fanny.</p>

<p>She could not help telling
her mother what a good girl
Nellie was, and how she loved
her sister, even when she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
unkind and spoke pettishly to
her.</p>

<p>Then she told her how much
she wished Nellie had a wax
doll, with real hair, and a white
silk dress. Mrs. Lee thought
such a good girl ought to have
one, and the very next time
she went to the city, she bought
the prettiest wax doll she could
find for her.</p>

<p>Flora was full of joy when
she saw the doll, and learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
whom it was for. She was a
great deal happier than if the
doll had been bought for herself;
and she wanted to run
right over to Mr. Green's with
the beautiful present. She
longed to see the eyes of Nellie
sparkle as she saw the doll,
and to hear what she would
say when told it was for her.
But Mrs. Lee thought they
had better keep the doll till
Christmas, and let her find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
it with her stocking in the
morning.</p>

<p>"But then I shan't see her
when she first gets the dolly,"
said Flora.</p>

<p>"That is true; but you must
write a little note, which shall
be pinned on the doll's dress."</p>

<p>"That will be splendid,
mother! And I will go right
away and write the note now."</p>

<p>Flora got a pencil and a
piece of paper, and seated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
herself in the corner. She
worked away for half an hour
as busy as a bee, and then she
carried the note to her mother.
She was not much of a writer,
having been to school only a
year. She could only print
the note.</p>

<p>Flora was very fond of
writing notes, and long before
she could make a single letter,
she would fill up a piece of
paper with pothooks and spi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>ders'
legs, and send them to
her mother and Frank.</p>

<p>She did not spell all the
words right, but her mother
told her how to correct them,
and then she printed the note
over again, on a nice sheet of
gilt-edged paper. Thinking
my little friends might want
to see this note, I place a copy
of it in the book, just exactly
as she wrote it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/letter.png" width="363" height="400" alt="Dear Nellie This Dolly is From Me. I Love You Very Much And I Wish You A Merry Christmas.  Flora Lee." title="Dear Nellie This Dolly is From Me. I Love You Very Much And I Wish You A Merry Christmas.  Flora Lee." />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>When Christmas morning
came, Nellie found the doll in
a chair, close by her stocking.
I can't tell you how pleased
she was, but you can all
guess. Then she took the
note from the dress, and read
it. She was more pleased
than ever to find it was from
Flora.</p>

<p>She almost cried with joy
as she puzzled out the note,
and thought how kind Flora<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and her mother were to remember
her.</p>

<p>"What a dear you are, Miss
Dolly!" said she, as she took
up the doll and kissed her,
just as though she had been
a real live baby. "You and
I shall be first-rate friends,
just as long as we live. I will
take such good care of you!
Dear me! Why, mother! Only
think!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Nel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>lie?"
asked Mrs. Green, who
was almost as much pleased
as her daughter.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?"</p>

<p>"What, child? What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"Did you see those eyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see them."</p>

<p>"Why, just as true as I am
alive, she moved them!"</p>

<p>"I think not, my child. She
is a very handsome doll, but I
don't think she could move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
her eyes, if she tried ever so
hard."</p>

<p>"But she did; I know she
did;" and Nellie took hold
of her head to examine it
more closely. As she did so,
she bent the body a little.
"There! as true as I live, she
moved them again!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Green took the doll,
and found that the eyes did
really move. It was funny,
but it was true. Mrs. Lee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and Flora knew all about it.
The eyes were made of glass,
and there was something inside
of the doll which moved
them when the body was bent.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Katy,
who had been looking on in
silence all this time. Nellie
gave her the doll at once;
and she bent the body and
saw the eyes move twenty
times. The happy owner of
Miss Dolly waited with pa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>tience
till her sister had done
with her.</p>

<p>"Why didn't aunt Jane get
me one like that, I wonder,"
said Katy, when she gave the
doll to Nellie.</p>

<p>"I suppose she could not
afford to buy one like this, for
she is not so rich as Mrs. Lee."</p>

<p>"But you shall have her to
play with just when you want
her," said Nellie.</p>

<p>"Pooh! I don't want your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
old dolly," snarled Katy. "She
isn't half so good as mine. I
would rather have Lady Jane
than have her, any day."</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you wish
your aunt Jane had given
you one like this?" asked
her mother.</p>

<p>"I don't care for her old
dolly! She may keep it for
all me," replied Katy.</p>

<p>"But it shall be yours just
as much as mine, Katy," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Nellie, in tones so gentle and
sweet that her sister ought to
have kissed her for them, and
loved her more than she ever
loved her before.</p>

<p>But she did not. She was
envious. She was sorry the
doll had been given to Nellie&mdash;sorry
because it was a prettier
one than her own. It was
a very wicked feeling. She
had some presents of her own,
but her envy spoiled all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
pleasure she might have taken
in them.</p>

<p>Nellie was almost sorry the
doll had been given to her,
when she saw how Katy felt
about it. Mrs. Green talked
to the envious girl till she
cried, about her conduct. She
tried to make her feel how
odious and wicked envy made
her.</p>

<p>Whenever Katy saw the
new doll, she seemed to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
angry with her sister. Poor
Nellie's pleasure was nearly
spoiled, and she even offered
to exchange her doll for
Katy's, but her mother would
not let her do so.</p>

<p>In a few days, however, she
seemed to feel better, and the
two sisters had some good
times with their dolls. I say
she seemed to feel better, but
she really did not. She did
not like it that Nellie's doll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
was a finer one than her
own.</p>

<p>Yet Nellie was happier, for
she thought Katy was cured
of her ill feeling. Then she
loved her doll more than ever.
She was a cunning little girl,
and she thought so much of
her new friend that she always
used to say "Dolly and I."</p>

<p>When her mother asked her
where she had been, she would
reply, "Dolly and I have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
having a nice time up stairs."
"Dolly and I" used to do ever
so many things, and no two
little ladies could ever enjoy
themselves more than did
Dolly and Nellie.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that Katy
did not like Dolly at all. She
could never forgive her for
moving her eyes, because Lady
Jane could not move hers. It
is true that, after she saw how
silly and wicked her envy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
made her appear to others, she
tried very hard not to show it.</p>

<p>We may be just as wicked
without showing our sin to
others, as we can be when we
let the world see just what we
are. When we are wicked,
the sin is more in the heart
than in the actions.</p>

<p>Men may seem to be very
good when they are really
very bad, though people almost
always find out such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
persons. Katy was just as
wicked, just as envious, when
her sister thought she was
kind and loving, as she was
on that Christmas morning,
when the doll was found in
the chamber.</p>

<p>You will be surprised and
sorry when you see just how
wicked her envy made her.
I shall tell you about it in the
next chapter, and I hope it
will lead you to drive any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
such feeling from your own
hearts. If you have such feelings,
they will make you very
unhappy; and the sooner you
begin to get rid of them, the
better.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV.</h2>


<p><span class='smcap'>Lady Jane</span> and Miss Dolly
were kept in the lower drawer
of the bureau, for they were
very fine young ladies, and
Mrs. Green wished to have
them kept clean and nice.</p>

<p>One day, about two weeks
after Miss Dolly was given to
Nellie, both she and Katy had
been playing with the dolls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
When the bell rang for tea,
they ran down stairs; but before
they went they put the
dolls in the drawer. As they
were in a hurry, they were not
very careful, and the dresses
of both the dolls were sadly
tumbled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green, who was in the
room, saw in what manner
Miss Dolly and Lady Jane
had been thrown into the
drawer; and before she went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
down to tea, she took them
both out, smoothed down their
dresses, and put them back in
a more proper manner.</p>

<p>Katy and Nellie had had
some talk about their dolls;
and the envious girl had said
hers was better than her sister's.
Nellie did not dispute
with her about it, but she saw
that Katy had not got over
that bad feeling yet.</p>

<p>The children ate their sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>pers,
and not a word more
was said about the dolls; but
Katy looked very sour. She
was thinking about Miss Dolly's
eyes, and wishing Lady
Jane's eyes would move like
the other's.</p>

<p>She finished her supper, and
ran up stairs again. By this
time it was quite dark in the
room where the dolls were
kept, and Nellie and her
mother wondered why she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
went up stairs at that late
hour.</p>

<p>Katy was still thinking of
those eyes. She thought her
aunt Jane was real mean not
to buy her such a doll; and
then she was very sorry that
Flora's mother had bought it
for her sister.</p>

<p>While she was thinking
these wicked thoughts she went
to the bureau, and opened the
lower drawer. It was so dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
she could hardly see the dolls,
but she took out one of them.</p>

<p>"Your dolly shall not be
better than mine any longer,"
said she to herself.</p>

<p>As she said this, she took
the scissors from the work
basket on the bureau, and
finding one of the eyes with
her fingers, she struck one of
the points right into it. Then
she turned the scissors, so as
entirely to destroy the eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Not content with this, she
spoiled the other eye in the
same manner.</p>

<p>"Now your doll isn't so
good as mine, any how," said
she to herself, as she put the
poor spoiled lady back into
the drawer.</p>

<p>I would not have a little
girl feel as she felt then for
all the world. Her heart was
full of envy and wickedness.
To gratify her ill feeling she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
had thrust the scissors into
the eyes of the doll. She
knew how badly her sister
would feel, but she did not
care for this. Now Lady
Jane was the best doll, and
she did not care for any thing
else.</p>

<p>She staid in the room but
a few moments. Closing the
drawer, she hastened down
stairs, and took a seat by the
fire. She tried to look as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
though nothing had happened;
but she was sour and sullen,
for she felt that she had done
a very naughty act.</p>

<p>"Come, Katy; let us go up
stairs, and play with the dollies
again," said Nellie, when
she had got through with her
supper.</p>

<p>"I don't want to," replied
she, without even looking at
her sister.</p>

<p>"Do come, Katy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you I don't want
to," snarled she.</p>

<p>"You can bring your dolly
down stairs, and play with her
here, Nellie," said her mother.</p>

<p>"May I, mother?"</p>

<p>"You may&mdash;take a light
with you."</p>

<p>"I don't want any light,
mother; I can find her just
as well in the dark;" and
away she ran to get the doll.</p>

<p>Don't you think Katy trem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>bled
then? She did tremble,
like a leaf, and wished she
had not done the naughty
deed. In a moment Nellie
would return with poor Miss
Dolly, whose eyes had been
spoiled with the scissors. She
did not think it would be
found out so soon, and she
could not think what to say
before the doll came down.</p>

<p>She felt just as though she
should sink through the floor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
when Nellie came into the
room with the doll in her
arms. There would be an
awful time in a moment, and
her father and mother would
want to know who had spoiled
Miss Dolly's eyes.</p>

<p>They knew she had been up
stairs since tea, and they would
charge her with the naughty
act. She meant to deny it,
for those who are wicked
enough to do such things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
are almost always wicked
enough to lie about them.</p>

<p>"Now won't you and I have
a nice time, Dolly?" said Nellie,
as she rushed into the sitting
room, with the doll in
her arms. "Come, Katy, let's
play Dolly is the queen of
England."</p>

<p>"I don't want to play."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;won't you make
me a crown for her?"</p>

<p>"I can't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Katy was waiting for her
sister to find out the mischief
that had been done, and she
dreaded the moment when
she should do so. She did
not dare to look at her, for
fear her looks might betray
her.</p>

<p>"You shall be queen without
any crown," said Nellie,
as she placed the doll on the
table. "This pincushion shall
be your throne. There, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
look just like a queen&mdash;don't
she, mother?"</p>

<p>"I think she does," replied
Mrs. Green, with a smile. "I
hope she will be as good as
Queen Victoria."</p>

<p>"She will, mother&mdash;only
she ought to have a crown."</p>

<p>"I have got a piece of gilt
paper up stairs, and I will
make her one. I'm going up
in a minute."</p>

<p>Katy, not daring to look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
yet, did not know what to
think of this talk. How could
the doll look like a queen when
her eyes had been punched
out with the scissors? It was
very strange to her, and she
stole a glance at the queenly
Miss Dolly on the table.</p>

<p>There she was, seated on
her pincushion throne, just as
if nothing had happened. Her
eyes were just as bright as
ever, and as Nelly bent her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
body, she moved them as well
as ever she could.</p>

<p>Katy did not know what to
make of it. She had certainly
driven the scissors into the
eyes of the doll as hard as
she could; but there was Miss
Dolly as good as new. She
could not explain it, and it
was of no use to try.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green brought down
the scissors, and cut out the
crown. Then Miss Dolly cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>tainly
looked like a queen,
and Nelly spent a very pleasant
hour with her majesty, till
it was time for her to go to
bed.</p>

<p>Katy was very unhappy.
She had not done what she
meant to do, and she was
filled with doubt. But she
did not have to wait long to
find out what she had done.
When Mrs. Green went up
stairs with the children, Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Dolly had to be put to bed
first, for she was a queen.</p>

<p>When the bureau drawer
was opened, what do you
think they saw? There lay
Lady Jane, with both of her
eyes punched out!</p>

<p>Katy burst into tears when
she saw that her doll was entirely
spoiled. Then she found
that she had made a mistake.
In the darkness she had
punched out the eyes of Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Jane instead of Miss Dolly.
This is the way that wicked
people often punish themselves
instead of others.</p>

<p>Her mother had changed
the places of the dolls in the
drawer, and this was the reason
why Katy had made the
mistake. Don't you think it
served her right?</p>

<p>Katy felt so badly that she
could not tell any of the lies
she had made up, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
truth was found out by her
mother. Mrs. Green scolded
her for what she had done,
and for what she meant to do.
The naughty girl cried herself
to sleep that night, but poor
Lady Jane was utterly ruined.</p>

<p>Nellie felt almost as bad as
her sister, and said all she could
to console her. The next day
Katy was so ashamed of herself
that she did not wish to
see any body. But in a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
days she got over it; and her
mother hoped the affair would
do her a great deal of good.
Whenever she showed a spirit
of envy, Mrs. Green reminded
her of her doll, and she tried
to conquer the feeling; but it
took many years to cure her.</p>

<p>When you envy others, although
you may not punch out
the eyes of your own doll, you
hurt yourself more than any
one else.</p>
